# Adventure Works Project

This project is dedicated to transforming and modeling data from the AdventureWorks dataset, hosted in Google BigQuery, to prepare it for insightful analysis and visualization. AdventureWorks is a sample database provided by Microsoft, which simulates a retail company's operations, including sales, product management, and customer interactions.

The transformations in this project focus on:

- Data modeling: building robust dimensions and fact tables to support various business analyses.
- Data quality: ensuring data integrity through rigorous testing and validation.
- Performance optimization: streamlining queries and models for efficient data processing and quick response times.
- Visualization readiness: structuring data in a way that facilitates easy integration with data visualization tools for reporting and dashboards.

This project serves as a foundational layer for business intelligence, enabling stakeholders to derive actionable insights from well-structured and reliable data.
